SIMPLE: # The basic thermostat, turns on when the temperature is above 5 degrees
  TEMP: 6 # Set at 6 degrees, they are within the budget

OPPORTUNIST: # Supercools the room to LOW_TEMP if power costs less than PRICE_OPPORTUNITY_THRESHOLD. Will turn on at HIGH_TEMP.
  LOW_TEMP: 3.6
  HIGH_TEMP: 6.37
  PRICE_OPPORTUNITY_THRESHOLD: 2

BARGAIN: # Just buys whenever power is cheaper than PRICE_THRESHOLD. VERY bad.
  PRICE_THRESHOLD: 1.5
